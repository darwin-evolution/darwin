  "body": "![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/darwin-evolution/darwin.svg)\r\n![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)\r\n\r\n### Why ?\r\nHave you ever faced a situation when you wanted to refactor some code, but there were no testes, nobody\r\nactually knows what this code should do exactly, everybody wants to change it but they are all afraid \r\nand don't want to risk ? Then this library is exactly for you! It allows you to write your new implementation\r\nand execute it in test harness alongside existing implementation (you can deploy it even in production environment), \r\nreturning values computed by original implementation, so nothing changes for end user. \r\nDarwin will monitor and log all executions, comparing results returned by both implementations.\r\nLogs will contain every information you need to decide if your implementation is mature enough to be used instead \r\nof old one.\r\n\r\n### How ?\r\nAdd maven dependency:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>com.github.darwin-evolution</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>darwin</artifactId>\r\n    <version>0.9.1</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSample evolution:\r\n\r\n        final Integer a = 1, b = 3, c = -1;\r\n\r\n        Integer max = Evolution.<Integer>of(\"calculateMax\")\r\n                .from(new ProtoplastExecutionHarness<Integer>() {\r\n                    @Override\r\n                    public Integer execute() throws Exception {\r\n                        arguments(a, b, c);\r\n                        return calculateMax(a, b, c);\r\n                    }\r\n                })\r\n                .to(new EvolvedExecutionHarness<Integer>() {\r\n                    @Override\r\n                    public Integer execute() throws Exception {\r\n                        arguments(a, b, c);\r\n                        return calculateMax2(a, b, c);\r\n                    }\r\n                })\r\n                .evolve();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDamian Kolasa (@fatfredyy)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Darwin?
